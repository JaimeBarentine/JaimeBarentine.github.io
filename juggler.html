  <p>A VR-capable PC and VR headset is required to play. The Quest 2 and Index are both confirmed to work.</p>
  <p>While on New World, Experis hosted a company game jam; the theme was juggling. I had been experimenting making several VR prototypes with various concepts, and thought this was the perfect opportunity to finally follow through on a VR game idea from start to finish.</p>
  <p>The game jam lasted two months, and in that time I learned a lot about VR development, and developing 3D games in general. I completed and used the most detailed 3D model I&#39;ve made up to this point, using knowledge and skills I acquired from Blender tutorials and my 3DS Max classes in college. I learned how to rig and import the model into the game, I learned how to work with procedural animations, and gained experience building 3D scenes. I modelled everything in the game myself.</p>
  <p>The planning process that I went through while I was prototyping out the controls consisted of researching the history of juggling, watching videos of different juggling performers, drawing concept art of environments and jugglable objects, and having friends and family play the prototype while I took notes on what people seemed to find the most exciting. I also had a lot of ideas and concept art that didn&#39;t end up making the cut due to my limited time and resources. So if one day I were to flesh out this concept for a full game or as part of another, I have more to work with.</p>
  <p>The biggest challenge of this project was being the only person working on it. As this was an Experis company game jam, the only people I was allowed to co-develop with are other Experis employees, otherwise I would have worked together with my brother. I worked myself very hard to make this project by the deadline, but it came with a mental and emotional toll. I learned a great lesson about what kind of work I would split up and delegate out in a team setting.</p>
  <p>I included this project because it&#39;s my first publicly released VR game, and I intend to make more. Since I did all of the work myself, this game is a showcase of just how broad my skillset is. From researching, to drawing concept art, to writing design documents, to setting up VR systems in Unity, coding, prototyping, playtesting, 3D modelling, rigging, animating, bug testing, even my 3 years of video production classes came in handy for the making of the trailer. This game represents a large chunk of my many talents, and showcases my ability to take on diverse roles in development.</p>
