    <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">DUUD is an online multiplayer co-op game where players team up to fight a parody of the bouncing DVD logo. It was co-developed by my brother and I. This was my first experience developing an online multiplayer game, and my first experience co-developing a game using a repository system to make branching commits and share updates.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Although the game is simple at the moment, this was my introduction to working with code that depends on an internet connection. The experience taught me about concepts such as how to handle server/client relations and which ones run certain commands, client delay, and client-side prediction. From co-developing, I learned about organizing files and code for maximum readability, the flow of writing update notes, committing, pushing, and pulling using Github.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Overall, the biggest skill I gained from this project was the social aspect of working creatively with a co-developer. We both fell into certain roles naturally based on our strengths and weaknesses. When tasks required a second person, we helped each other out. I've been making sure to document technical aspects as we go, so this knowledge can be applied to more complex projects in the future.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The biggest challenge of this project was simply coordinating our development and testing time. My brother and I are both doing this as a side project, so we've been dedicating on average a day a week to its development. Another challenge was getting the bullets to sync for both players, which involves client-side prediction.</p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Although this game is still a work in progress, it makes me excited at the prospect of working with a team as a developer. Seeing where my strengths can come to a group's aid was very rewarding, and solving problems by looking at them from different perspectives becomes easier when there are multiple people. I'm interested to work with more multiplayer projects, and see how solutions change when games are scaled to a much greater size.</p>
