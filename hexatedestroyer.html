    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Foxwood.HexateDestroyer&hl=en_US&gl=US" style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Hexate Destroyer - Google Play Store
    </a>
  </div>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Hexate Destroyer is the first video game I ever completed and released to an official platform. My work on this project taught me much about coding with C# and developing in the Unity engine. I learned how to organize assets, put together coherent scenes in the editor, and create multiple interdependent systems for handling the game’s logic and on-screen action. It gave me experience in writing a story, sound design, and graphical art since I handled everything myself except the music. It also introduced me to the Google Play Store as my first official platform, and taught me about game rating systems, writing privacy statements, managing updates, and setting up a store page.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The research I did to make this project a reality consisted of a lot of sifting through Unity’s APIs, looking at other peoples’ forum posts, making my own forum posts, and Googling error codes. I also had made several experimental prototype games in Unity for a few years before this, which familiarized me with Unity’s interface.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Everything I learned about bug testing this game, crunch when it was almost time to release, and even licensing the music all taught me valuable lessons about the video game industry. I will be sure to remember each mistake and pain point so the next time I release a game it won’t be so difficult.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I faced many challenges during the making of this project, the main of which just being that it was the first time I ever gave myself a deadline. I worked very hard to fix all the important bugs before the day came. And when it did, I was scrambling to get everything ready, but managed to get it out on time at a quality level I’m proud of.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I selected this project because, although I knew a lot about Unity, coding, and video games before this, Hexate Destroyer is the first time I ever forced myself to really put that knowledge to the test. I gave myself 4 months to make a game just to see if I could do it, and I did.
