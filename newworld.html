  <p>I&#39;ve been on New World for a year. Working on the engine QA team, I learned about testing MMOs, the game&#39;s editor, and the engine&#39;s underlying systems as developers make changes to it. This project was my first corporate experience working with a game&#39;s editor, and my first time working closely with the developers.</p>
  <p>Much of what the engine team handles covers changes to the game&#39;s core systems. I&#39;ve learned about how rendering systems work on a technical level, many industry standard editor features used for modern 3D AAA games, server/multiplayer systems, an introduction to bot scripting, and a glimpse into the daily life of an engineer.</p>
  <p>I already had experience writing bugs in the Azure database, and writing documentation using OneNote. This job expanded that to writing bugs in Jira, and documentation through Confluence. I was also introduced to Perforce, my first repository system, which is used daily to keep editor builds up to date, and sync to branched builds for testing changes. I learned how to deploy data planes to servers and builds to Steam, and got some experience using Jenkins for automation.</p>
  <p>The biggest challenge of this project has to have been drinking from the firehose of information that was required before I could start doing impactful work. There are several interdependent systems and processes that don&#39;t always make sense in a vacuum, so much of my onboarding involved taking lots of notes for myself on top of using existing documentation to make sure I don&#39;t miss any important steps. Once I understood our processes on the whole, I actually preferred tasks that challenged me to understand technical concepts.</p>
  <p>New World is the second game I&#39;ve been a long-term QA tester for. I included it because it&#39;s the most hands-on I&#39;ve ever been with a AAA game up to this point. I&#39;m in dev meetings every morning, and in direct contact with engineers almost every day. So I&#39;ve been given a window into what will be expected of me when I take on an engineer role. I&#39;ve met a lot of great people, made solid connections, and expanded my repertoire of skills and knowledge.</p>
