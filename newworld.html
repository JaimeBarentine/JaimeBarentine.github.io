  <p>I&#39;ve been a tester on New World for over a year. Working on the engine QA team, I learned about MMOs, and the engine&#39;s underlying systems as developers make changes to it. It was also my first experience using Python to write a functional tool for other people to use for bot automation.</p>
  <p>Much of what the engine team handles covers changes to the game&#39;s core systems. I&#39;ve learned about how rendering systems work on a technical level, many industry standard editor features used for modern 3D AAA games, server/multiplayer systems, running and writing bot scripts for automation, and the daily life of an engineer.</p>
  <p>I already had experience writing code from college, but this job allowed me to actually apply it to create something. This job also expanded my experience to using the Jira database, writing documentation through Confluence, and the repository system Perforce. I learned how to deploy data planes to servers and builds to Steam, and used Jenkins for automation.</p>
  <p>The biggest challenge of this project has to have been drinking from the firehose of information that was required before I could start doing impactful work. There are several interdependent systems and processes that don&#39;t always make sense in a vacuum, so much of my onboarding involved taking lots of notes for myself. Once I understood our processes on the whole, I actually preferred tasks that challenged me to understand technical concepts, and specialized in testing systems that other testers were daunted by.</p>
  <p>New World is the second game I&#39;ve been a long-term QA tester for. It&#39;s the most hands-on I&#39;ve ever been with a AAA game up to this point, and my first experience coding a graphical program to be used by a team. I&#39;m in dev meetings every morning, and in direct contact with engineers almost every day; I&#39;ve been given a window into what will be expected of me when I take on an engineer role. I&#39;ve met a lot of great people, made solid connections, and expanded my repertoire of skills and knowledge.</p>
