  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I've been on New World for a year. Working on the engine QA team, I learned about testing MMOs, the game's editor, and the engine's underlying systems as developers make changes to it. This project was my first corporate experience working with a game's editor, and my first time working closely with the developers. 
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Much of what the engine team handles covers changes to the game's core systems. I've learned about how rendering systems work on a technical level, many industry standard editor features used for modern 3D AAA games, server/multiplayer systems, an introduction to bot scripting, and a glimpse into the daily life of an engineer.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I already had experience writing bugs in the Azure database, and writing documentation using OneNote. This job expanded that to writing bugs in Jira, and documentation through Confluence. I was also introduced to Perforce, my first repository system, which is used daily to keep editor builds up to date, and sync to branched builds for testing changes. I learned how to deploy data planes to servers and builds to Steam, and got some experience using Jenkins for automation.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The biggest challenge of this project has to have been drinking from the firehose of information that was required before I could start doing impactful work. There are several interdependent systems and processes that don't always make sense in a vacuum, so much of my onboarding involved taking lots of notes for myself on top of using existing documentation to make sure I don't miss any important steps. Once I understood our processes on the whole, I actually preferred tasks that challenged me to understand technical concepts.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">New World is the second game I've been a long-term QA tester for. I included it because it's the most hands-on I've ever been with a AAA game up to this point. I'm in dev meetings every morning, and in direct contact with engineers almost every day. So I've been given a window into what will be expected of me when I take on an engineer role. I've met a lot of great people, made solid connections, and expanded my repertoire of skills and knowledge.
