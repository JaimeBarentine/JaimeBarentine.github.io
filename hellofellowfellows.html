  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The embedded demo above only works on desktop. Versions for other platforms are in the works.

  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The research I did to make this project a reality consisted of a lot of sifting through Unity’s APIs, looking at other peoples’ forum posts, making my own forum posts, and Googling error codes. I also had made several experimental prototype games in Unity for a few years before this, which familiarized me with Unity’s interface.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">Everything I learned about bug testing this game, crunch when it was almost time to release, and even licensing the music all taught me valuable lessons about the video game industry. I will be sure to remember each mistake and pain point so the next time I release a game it won’t be so difficult.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I faced many challenges during the making of this project, the main of which just being that it was the first time I ever gave myself a deadline. I worked very hard to fix all the important bugs before the day came. And when it did, I was scrambling to get everything ready, but managed to get it out on time at a quality level I’m proud of.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I selected this project because, although I knew a lot about Unity, coding, and video games before this, Hexate Destroyer is the first time I ever forced myself to really put that knowledge to the test. I gave myself 4 months to make a game just to see if I could do it, and I did.
