  <p>The embedded demo above only works on desktop. Versions for other platforms are in the works.</p>
  <p>This is my second upcoming game, which has a demo that can be played in the browser on this website! This is my first official project after having spent some time working in the video game industry. It was an opportunity to finally try out a lot of the efficient development and testing processes that I picked up on, and was a really good quarantine project. It started from my need to draw, which I hadn&#39;t been lately, and evolved into a game where you play as a doodle on the side of a college paper.</p>
  <p>It was also a good practice to keep my artistic skills sharp, because I researched cartoons, animation, and other various art mediums for years, starting in middle school, through Youtube tutorials and befriending other artists. All drawings for this game are done on paper, and photographed instead of scanned to give that paper aesthetic.</p>
  <p>This project has forced me to learn about creating an advertising campaign for it. This is very necessary knowledge and practice for all subsequent games I develop, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s pushing me to figure it out now rather than later.</p>
  <p>The hardest challenge about this project has to be the code for terrain generation; levels are procedurally generated, meaning it randomly builds the level as you play, so it&#39;s different with every new run. It may have been difficult, but I spent more time refining this system than any other, because it is the core of what makes the game work.</p>
  <p>I selected this work because it is my next official project, and representative of how far I&#39;ve come at this point. The game was designed to be ported to pretty much anything from PC to phone to console, so it shows my versatility of platform.</p>
