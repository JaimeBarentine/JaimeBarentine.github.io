  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I spent 3 years on this project. In that time I learned about how video games are tested and made in a AAA setting, I learned how to write constructive bugs and manage items in the Azure database, I gained the social skills to work towards collective goals with a team in an office, and learned many other ins and outs about the processes of game development that can only be picked up from being in the industry first-hand. Having Flight Simulator as my first QA job has put my foot in the door and introduced me to the reality of how video games are made on a corporate level.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">I had learned a bit about testing from making my own projects already, but I was built up and taught by veteran testers at this job. I spent time learning how the sim’s various systems work, and made myself the specialist people go to when they have questions about those systems.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The industry standard testing, fixing, and iterating process that I’ve observed from working here has already helped me in making my own development more efficient. I’ve changed how I prioritize which aspects of my personal projects and when.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">The hardest part of working on Flight Simulator was having to learn how actual planes work in real life to test many of the aircrafts’ features, which required research and teamwork. This could mean interfacing with specialists to ask questions about expected functionalities, which could become quite technically challenging.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:60px;margin-right:60px;text-align:center">This is the biggest and most widely recognizable project out of everything I’ve worked on. Microsoft Flight Simulator has been a gaming tradition since 1979, and my continued work on it as a QA tester is proof that I can hold my own in the industry.
